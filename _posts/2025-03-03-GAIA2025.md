On 21-24 February 2025 I went to Atami, Shizuoka, Japan for my first international conference. The event was [the first Geomechanics Alliance in Asia (GAIA) workshop](https://www.kz.tsukuba.ac.jp/~tmatsu/GAIA_homepage/index.html), organized by Tsukuba University.

A little bit about GAIA is that it is a *new* group that aims to do annual academic events that focuses on facilitating students and young researchers in presenting, discussing research and also developing networks within the geomechanics field in Asia. This was their first *workshop*. They purposely designed the event to be a 'limited' workshop rather than a 'big' conventional conference. There was no publication involved, only oral and poster presentation (unpublished poster). The intention was so that the limitation in the number of participants allows *everyone* to participate in high quality interactions (presentations and discussions), which is hard to get in a traditional academic conference. And the event was exactly like that, the overall 'vibe' was more family gathering-like, everybody was quickly became acquainted with each other, people naturally started discussing things and everybody were jumping in and out between different kinds of discussions right from the first night. The 'super chill' atmosphere really helps with the young participants who was nervous with giving their first international talk (me :D).

I got the chance to give an oral presentation despite only being 1st year PhD student, the others were at least 2nd year, probably thanks to one of the committee also being my せんぱい (previous PhD graduate of my laboratory, thank you!).

_Me during my presentation. The photo was taken during the early part of the presentation (introduction), when I was still nervous and has not realized that I was standing right on the edge of the stage lol. I moved slowly toward the center of the stage as the presentation proceeded. (photo's credit to GAIA's committee)_

My presentation was titled: "Micromechanical Simulation of Soil Liquefaction using Discrete and Finite Elements". In short, I presented my laboratory's work on computer simulation of [soil liquefaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_liquefaction) using the [Discrete Element Method coupled with Finite Element Method](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344837644_Towards_a_Micromechanical_Understanding_of_Landslides-Aiming_at_a_Combination_of_Finite_and_Discrete_Elements_with_Minimal_Number_of_Degrees_of_Freedom). The experience was definitely unique, my research's *'micromechanical'* perspective (meaning that we are interested in simulating the *actual* micro-mechanical interactions between soil particles) is very different with most (if not all) of the other participants. I'm not going to elaborate on how does it differs in this post, but I want to say that dealing with discussions and questions from people that have completely different perspective was fun, especially because up to now I've been only discussing things with my supervisor and lab mates whose perspective are obviously the same. I don't know whether I can say the same if the setting was during a 'traditional conference' where people usually are more "judgy" towards each other, but in GAIA's workshop setting, I was actually enjoying my time on stage during the presentation.

The trip to Atami was my first trip in Japan via the *shinkansen*. I rode the *kodama shinkansen* (kodama means 'echo' in Japanese). It was ok, nothing particularly new to me as I have rode other [high-speed train back in Indonesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kereta_Cepat_Indonesia_China). During the trip I also saw my first snow fall in my life (only saw and not experienced as it was a very light snow, the flakes basically instantly melted when they touch the ground). Additionally, Atami is a very well known area in Japan for it's *onsen* (hot-spring) and the place we were staying had an outdoor *onsen* facing the sea (I went to the *onsen* early, nobody was there and I got my self my private *onsen* facing the pacific ocean, it was great).And I had probably the best Japanese meal I ever had.

_Traditional Japanese-style *teishoku* (complete set of meal) for dinner. Honestly I don't know what they are other than they are seafood._

In conclusion, GAIA's first workshop was a great experience, especially for someone like me who is new to the international academic context. I was given the chance to present, discuss and make connections to many of the participants, ranging from the young researchers to the experts. For me, I think the event was a *smooth introduction* to the international academic community. And the food was great (probably the best part of the whole event, jk :D)
