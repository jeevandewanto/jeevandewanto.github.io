August 13th 2024, me and my friends went for a camping trip to Mt. Gede, West Java. It was our last hike together before my departure to Japan. In this post, I want share series of photos I took, presented with a little bit of narration.

We departed early in the morning from Tangerang around 4.30 AM, or at least that was the plan. As expected some of us (just one person, actually) was late. But we still managed to arrive by 8 AM in Bogor Station.

Ate some *bubur ayam* for a quick breakfast. Bubur ayam is a very common breakfast in Indonesia. Basically just a chicken congee served with shredded chicken, scallions, crispy shallots, fried soybeans, soy sauce (both salty and sweet), kerupuk (Indonesian-style crackers) and of course sambal. Super good and satisfying.

Arrived at the hiking station around 10 AM, stopped by at a *warung* for a quick water refuel and phone battery recharge. We also did a quick health check-up (super simple one, just body temp and blood pressure). It was nice to know that we now have health check-up unit at the hiking station. The check-up was apparently mandatory and paid (not included in the [SIMAKSI](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/simaksi) cost), but it was only Rp. 25,000 per person so not a big deal.

After submitting our SIMAKSI to the mountain ranger office, we finally begin our hike around 11 AM. Super hot, sunny day.

Mt. Gede is a stratovolcano located in West Java, Indonesia. It is a part of the Mount Gede Pangrango National Park. The national park itself was named from the two volcanoes present inside of it, Mt. Gede and Mt. Pangrango. For this hike, we were only hiking Mt. Gede.

_Mt. Gede National Park._

Being a stratovolcano, Mt. Gede has a conical shape. It was built up by many layers (strata) of hardened lava. So, just like other stratovolcanoes, Mt. Gede has a very steep profile with a huge crater on it's summit.

There are 3 hiking routes available: Jalur Putri, Jalur Cibodas and Jalur Selabintana. Our plan was to hike up via Jalur Putri (the shortest one, 6-7 hours), set up our camp at the Surya Kencana savanna, reach the summit the next morning, and finally descent via the Jalur Cibodas (the longest one, 10 hours).

Most of the route was tropical forest with tall trees and large tree roots covering the ground. The thing with this kind of route is that they rarely have smooth ground to walk on. The roots form natural staircases that makes the hike even harder, on top of being quite steep already. Additionally, being the shortest route, Jalur Putri is also the steepest of the three routes. 

![dalamhutan](/assets/img/gede2024/track2.JPG){: w="480"}
_This is what Jalur Putri looks like in general, very steep with lots of tree roots_

On the way, we took our periodic rest and stop by any *warung* we found along the track (yes, we have *warung* in the middle of the forest).

We finally reached our camping ground, 'Alun-Alun Surya Kencana', which is a savanna located just below the peak of Mt. Gede. We arrived around 5 PM, making our hike took about 6 hours (not too bad I think, considering we were taking our time and not pushing ourselves too hard).

A bit sad to see lots of trash present in Surya Kencana and a bit ashamed to show this to the internet but this was the state of Mt. Gede. This was during off-season, so there were not much people around. You can imagine the thrash during high-season.

_I quite like this particular shot of the Edelweis flower with the mountain ridge in the background, highlighted by the soft orange sunset light, contrast with the clear blue sky_

Surya Kencana is already 2750 meters above sea level (masl), only 200 meters below the peak of Mt. Gede. From here we can already see the sea of clouds below us.

As the sun sets, the temperature quickly started dropping below $\mathrm{10}^\circ \mathrm{C}$. We did not spent much time exploring Surya Kencana since we had limited time to set up our tent before dark.

We decided to walk a bit more, closer to the spring before setting up our tent. Walking through Surya Kencana during sunset with the reddish light hitting the dry savanna felt other-worldly to me (this was during the dry season, there's supposed to be a small stream of water in the middle of Surya Kencana during the wet season)

The temperature was quickly dropping and it was getting dark fast, we were in a hurry so I did not took any photo using my camera during the evening and night.

We quickly set up our tents, cooked simple dinner, drank warm tea, set up our mattresses + sleeping bag and immediately went to sleep, all while freezing. We had no idea that the temperature that night was going to be below $\mathrm{0}^\circ \mathrm{C}$.

Usually, when we went camping, we wake up early (3:00-4:00 AM) to reach the summit before sunrise. However, we decided to take it slow this time as we were going cross route, meaning that our ascend and descend route is different. This means that we had to pack all of our things before heading to the summit as we are passing through Surya Kencana on our descend. 

We woke up around 6:30 AM and found our tent covered in bits of ice from the frozen dew. My PET water bottle was also frozen (but not completely). We decided to stay and chill a little longer inside our tent as it was still too cold outside. We ate breakfast and drank some coffee until the sun is a bit higher. Our campsite was in the west side of the mountain peak so it took a while until we finally got sunlight directly warming us.

Around 7:00 AM we head out and explore Surya Kencana for several hours before packing our stuffs and continue our hike to the peak.
